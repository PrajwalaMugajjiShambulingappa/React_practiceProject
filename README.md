# React Practice Project: Movie Picker üé•

This is a simple React project that fetches movies from an API, displays them, and allows users to pick their favorite movies. The primary goal of this project was to review and reinforce basic React concepts such as:

- **useState** and **useEffect** for state management and side effects
- **Local Storage** for persistent data
- **Page Routing** using React Router
- **State Management** and Context API for sharing data between components
- **Conditional Rendering** for dynamic UI updates

## Features üåü

1. **Fetch Movies**: Displays a list of movies fetched from an external API.
2. **Favorite Movies**: Users can mark movies as their favorites.
3. **Persistent Favorites**: Favorite movies are saved using local storage, so they remain even after refreshing the page.
4. **Component-Based Architecture**: The project is structured into reusable components for modularity.
5. **Dynamic Page Routing**: Navigate between different views/pages within the app.
6. **Context API**: Shared state is managed using React's Context API for easy data flow across components.
